# Automated machine learning with PyCaret
**AutoML:** is the process of automating the tasks of applying [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to real-world problems. The high degree of automation in AutoML aims to allow non-experts to make use of machine learning [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning).
It started in the 1990s as a set of open source tools, like Weka, which helped research scientist and engineers automate tedious tasks, but gain popularity in 2020 which was due to the easy-to-use AutoML packages(python) and softwares development [Akkio](https://www.akkio.com/post/how-does-automated-machine-learning-work#:~:text=History%20of%20AutoML&text=It%20originated%20in%20the%201990s,development%20of%20more%20sophisticated%20techniques.).




#### A list of few **AutoML Systems ü§ñ:**
| [AutoWEKA](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/algorithms/Projects/autoweka/) | [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) | [H20](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) | [Auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) |[Auto-PyTorck](https://github.com/automl/Auto-PyTorch) | [AutoKeras](https://autokeras.com/)|
| --------- |--------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|

However in this repository we will just focus on the PyCaret AutoML library but readers are free to explore the others. For the regression task, the [housing dataset](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practical-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/main/14-Chapter-14/data) has been used for performing EDA and ML-regression task, while the in-built "Credit default" dataset made possible by PyCaret was used for the classification task, finally the Clustering was perform using [Kmeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#:~:text=k%2Dmeans%20clustering%20is%20a,a%20prototype%20of%20the%20cluster.) and [palmer's penguin](https://rpubs.com/michelle10128/923430) dataset which is a good alternative to [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

#### **Results and findings üîç (Supervised, Unsupervised learning algorithms):**
**1. [Regression](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/AutoML-PyCaret/blob/master/Notebooks/PyCaret_Regression.ipynb)** - R<sup>2</sup>:  0.7746

<br>

   
**2. [Classification](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/AutoML-PyCaret/blob/master/Notebooks/PyCaret_classification.ipynb)** Accuracy :   82.06% 

Note there are other metrics for evaluating the classifcation model depending on the application domain <br>
(precision, recall, F1-score, MCC) are all very useful.
