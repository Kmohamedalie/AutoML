# Automated machine learning
**AutoML:** is the process of automating the tasks of applying [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to real-world problems. The high degree of automation in AutoML aims to allow non-experts to make use of machine learning [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning).
It started in the 1990s as a set of open source tools, like Weka, which helped research scientist and engineers automate tedious tasks, but gain popularity in 2020 which was due to the easy-to-use AutoML packages(python) and softwares development [Akkio](https://www.akkio.com/post/how-does-automated-machine-learning-work#:~:text=History%20of%20AutoML&text=It%20originated%20in%20the%201990s,development%20of%20more%20sophisticated%20techniques.).
